* Your manually entered meal data now syncs perfectly with other health apps via **Health Connect**.
* Record in Supsiki, and manage your health data seamlessly across different platforms.

#### 3. Improved Product Comparison ⚖️

* We've made slight improvements to the comparison interface for better usability.
