# 🌏 Global Service Notice & Upcoming v1.0.3 Update (Under Review)

Hello, this is the **Supsiki** Team.

The promised **stability and feature expansion update (v1.0.3)** is currently **under review by Google Play**! Barring any major issues, it should be available to you very soon. Thank you sincerely for your patience and trust.

### ✅ What's Changing?

#### 1. Health Connect Watch Support (e.g., Galaxy Fit)
* It is okay if your watch does not run Wear OS (like the Galaxy Fit).
* If your watch app (e.g., Samsung Health) **successfully sends workout data to Health Connect**, Supsiki can now utilize that data.

#### 2. Hybrid Workout Mode (Non-Wear OS Watches)
* Even if your watch doesn't directly sync with Supsiki, try this:
* **"Use the Supsiki timer on your phone, and track the workout on your watch."**
* Once the data reaches Health Connect after your workout, Supsiki will merge it with the timer record to provide **precise analysis** and a **#WorkoutComplete** image.

#### 3. Stability Improvements & Update Guide
* We have improved the crash issues reported in the previous version.
* **Important:** Once the update is released, **the app will force close upon launch due to an error.**
* We apologize for the inconvenience, but please **open the Google Play Store directly** and manually tap **[Update]**. (This is a one-time fix!)

### 📢 We Need Your Help!
* When viewing Health Connect records, you might see a raw package name (e.g., `com.sec.android.app.shealth`) instead of the actual app name.
* If you spot this, please let us know in the **YouTube comments**!
* We will update it to a readable name in the next patch.

### 🤖 AI Analysis Feature Availability
* Supsiki strives to provide personalized health insights powered by **Gemini AI**.
* Currently, we are in the stage of **validating the feasibility of sustainable AI operations**, focusing on our primary supported regions.
* We plan to gradually expand the availability of AI features as we establish a stable operating model. We kindly ask for your understanding.

### 💎 Ad Integration for Sustainable Service
* To maintain and develop the app continuously, we have introduced an **ad system, including interstitial ads**, starting with this version.
* Ads may appear during the app experience or when generating **#WorkoutComplete** images.
* This transition allows us to keep our core features free while continuing to evolve the app for our users.

### ⭐ Premium Subscription (PRO)
* For an ad-free experience and more powerful tools, consider upgrading to our Premium plan:
* **Video Export (PRO)**
* **Advanced AI Specialization**
