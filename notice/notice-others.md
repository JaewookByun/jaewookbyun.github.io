#### 2. 'Smart Notifications' for Consistency
* Supsiki will help you stay on track with new alert features:
* **Morning Alert:** A greeting to start your day with energy and focus on your health.
* **External Workout Alert:** If a workout from another app (like Samsung Health) is detected via **Health Connect**, Supsiki will notify you so you don't miss a record.

#### 3. Expanded Multilingual Support
* Supsiki is going global!
* In addition to existing languages, we now support **German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Vietnamese, Thai, Malay, and Simplified Chinese.** Enjoy Supsiki with more natural translations worldwide.

### 📢 We Need Your Help!
* When viewing Health Connect records, you might see a raw package name (e.g., `com.sec.android.app.shealth`) instead of the actual app name.
* If you spot this, please let us know in the **YouTube comments**!
* We will update it to a readable name in the next patch.

### 🤖 AI Analysis Feature Availability
* Supsiki strives to provide personalized health insights powered by **Gemini AI**.
* Currently, we are in the stage of **validating the feasibility of sustainable AI operations**, focusing on our primary supported regions.
* We plan to gradually expand the availability of AI features as we establish a stable operating model. We kindly ask for your understanding.

### 💎 Ad Integration for Sustainable Service
* To maintain and develop the app continuously, we have introduced an **ad system, including interstitial ads**, starting with this version.
* Ads may appear during the app experience or when generating **#WorkoutComplete** images.
* This transition allows us to keep our core features free while continuing to evolve the app for our users.

### ⭐ Premium Subscription (PRO)
* For an ad-free experience and more powerful tools, consider upgrading to our Premium plan:
* **Video Export (PRO)**
* **Advanced AI Specialization**
