### 💡 Are you using the 'Daily Report' correctly?

We designed the Daily Report not just as a "final score" for the day, but as a **tool to shape a better day by checking it often**.
Here are some **Scenarios** to help you get the most out of it:

* **💧 Low Water Intake:**
    * **Report:** "Hydration is low. Metabolism might slow down."
    * **Action:** Drink a glass of water and log it.

* **💪 Protein but No Exercise:**
    * **Report:** "Good nutrition, but without stimulation (exercise), muscle growth is limited."
    * **Action:** Do some quick **Squats** or **Push-ups** and log them.
    * **Result:** Re-analyze to see: "Great! Your protein is now fueling muscle synthesis."

* **🍗 Hard Workout but Low Food:**
    * **Report:** "Not enough protein for your workout intensity. Risk of muscle loss."
    * **Action:** Eat a boiled egg or a **Protein Shake** and log it.
    * **Result:** Re-analyze to see: "Perfect timing! Muscle recovery mode activated."
