# 🥑 v1.0.5 Update: 'Manual Meal Entry' Added for Global Users!

Hello, this is the **Supsiki** developer.

Have you ever struggled to record food that couldn't be found via barcode or search?
To solve this inconvenience, especially for our global users who eat foods not listed in the Korean database, we now support a **Manual Entry** feature!

## ✅ Release Notes

### 1. Can't find the food? Enter it manually now! ✍️
Previously, you could only record via **Barcode, Korean Report Number, or Korean Name**. Any other food had to be recorded in external apps and synced via Health Connect.
Now, you can enter nutritional information directly within Supsiki!

**💡 Developer's Tips!**
* **Best Order:** For the most accuracy, enter values from the nutrition label in this order: **[Calories → Carbs → Protein → Fat]**.
* **Auto-Calculation:** If you don't want to calculate calories, just enter **[Carbs → Protein → Fat]**. Supsiki will automatically calculate the calories for you.
* **Global Friendly:** Don't worry if the package uses **kJ**. It automatically converts to **kcal** when you enter it.

### 2. Health Connect Two-Way Sync 🔗
Your manually entered meal data syncs perfectly with other health management apps via **Health Connect**. Record in Supsiki, and check your data anywhere.

### 3. Multi-Product Comparison Improved ⚖️
Did you know you can compare up to 4 products by scanning barcodes? We've made slight improvements to the comparison feature to make it even better.

### 4. Localization & Bug Fixes 🛠️
We have refined translations for our global users and fixed minor bugs to improve overall app stability.
