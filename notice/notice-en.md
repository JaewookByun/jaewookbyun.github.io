# 🚀 Upcoming v1.0.3 Update: Health Connect Watch Support (e.g., Galaxy Fit)

Hello, this is the developer of **Supsiki**.

Following our previous emergency notice, the promised **stability and feature expansion update (v1.0.3)** is currently **under review by Google Play**!
Barring any major issues, it should be available to you very soon. Thank you sincerely for your patience and trust.

## ✅ What's Changing?

### 1. Health Connect Watch Support (e.g., Galaxy Fit)
It is okay if your watch does not run Wear OS (like the Galaxy Fit).
If your watch app (e.g., Samsung Health) **successfully sends workout data to Health Connect**, Supsiki can now utilize that data.

### 2. Hybrid Workout Mode (Non-Wear OS Watches)
Even if your watch doesn't directly sync with Supsiki, try this:
**"Use the Supsiki timer on your phone, and track the workout on your watch."**
Once the data reaches Health Connect after your workout, Supsiki will merge it with the timer record to provide **precise analysis** and a **#WorkoutComplete** image.

### 3. Stability Improvements & Update Guide
We have fixed the crash issue from the previous version.
**Important:** Once the update is released, **the app will force close upon launch due to the error.** We apologize for the inconvenience, but please **open the Google Play Store directly** and manually tap **[Update]**. (This is a one-time fix!)

## 📢 We Need Your Help!
When viewing Health Connect records, you might see a raw package name (e.g., `com.sec.android.app.shealth`) instead of the app name.
If you spot one, please report it in the **YouTube comments**! We will update it to a readable name in the next patch.
