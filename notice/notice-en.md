# 📢 Urgent Update Notice (v1.0.2.4)

Hello, this is the developer of **Supsiki**.

Since the last update, many of you have shown great interest in the newly added **'Stretching Guide', 'Cooldown Guide', and 'AI Workout Analysis'** features.

I sincerely thank you.

However, we identified an unfortunate issue where ads were not loading properly in some user environments, preventing access to these useful features even when users wanted to use them.

I apologize for not being able to assist you during the most critical moments—before, during, and after your workouts. We deployed an **urgent hotfix** immediately upon discovering the issue.

## 🛠️ Hotfix Details

### ✅ Ad System & Feature Stabilization
- **Resolved Connectivity Issues:** Fixed a bug where **'AI Workout Analysis'** and **'Cooldown Guide'** requests would receive no response depending on network environments or regions (including overseas).

## 🗣️ Feedback Channel
If you experience any inconvenience or have suggestions while using the app, please leave a comment on the **Developer YouTube Community** below.

I promise to **review every single comment with sincerity and respond accordingly**, ensuring not even the smallest suggestion is missed.

- **I will monitor more closely and listen more carefully to ensure that not a single user misses out on Supsiki's care.**
Have a healthy day with Supsiki!

Thank you.
