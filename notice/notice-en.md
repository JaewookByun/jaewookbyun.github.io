# 📢 Urgent Notice: App Crash Issue & How to Resolve

Hello, this is the **Supsiki** developer.

First of all, **if you are reading this post, it means your Supsiki app is safe.** You can rest assured! 😄

However, some users are currently experiencing crashes (forced termination) immediately upon launching the app. We are sharing this guide to help those affected and to inform you of the solution.

## 🚨 Issue & Cause
In specific versions (v1.0.2.3 ~ v1.0.2.4.1), a **crash occurs during the 'Auto Update' process.**

To maximize user convenience, we introduced a **'Seamless Update'** feature to load the latest version immediately upon launch. However, **a conflict occurred between the Google Play API's security policy (Intent Lifecycle) and certain device environments.** We have identified the root cause and have already taken action.

## 🛠️ Solution (Until v1.0.3 Release)
We are currently preparing **v1.0.3**, which includes a fundamental fix for this issue along with **new features**.
However, for the versions currently experiencing this problem, the app cannot recover itself through internal logic (since it crashes on start).

We apologize for the inconvenience, but **please visit the Google Play Store directly to update manually until v1.0.3 is released.**

1. Open the **[Google Play Store]** app on your phone.
2. Search for **'Supsiki'**.
3. Tap the **[Update]** button.
